abstract: "It has been shown that both fear of missing out (FoMO) and problematic (i.e., excessive) smartphone use (PSU) are negatively  associated  with  indicators  of  emotional  well-being.  Moreover,  FoMO  has  been  found  to  be  a  key predictor of PSU. This suggests that PSU may mediate the relation between FoMO and decreased emotional well-being but this pathway has never been tested. Moreover, in most studies on PSU, the multidimensional nature of this  construct  has  been  ignored.  The  aim  of  the  present  study  was  to  address  these  gaps  by  directlytesting  the mediating  role  of  (subdimensions  of)  PSU  in  the  association  between  FoMO  and  emotional  well-being.  We conducted  a  cross-sectional  study  with  Estonian  participants  (n=426).  Using  a  simple  mediation  analysis,  we found that PSU partially mediated the relationship between FoMO and decreased emotional well-being. Using a parallel  mediation  analysis,  we  found  that  two  specific  dimensions  of  PSU  were  significant  mediators  of  the relationship  between  FoMO  and  decreased  emotional  well-being:  Cyberspace-oriented  Relations  and  Physical Symptoms. This suggests that the negative relationship between FoMO and decreased emotional well-being is due to FoMO stimulating (a) online relationships at the cost of offline interactions and (b) Physical symptoms associated with  excessive  smartphone  use.  Overall,  this  study  provides  a  fine-grained  analysis  of  the  relationship  between FoMO, PSU and emotional well-being."
