abstract: "The present research conducted by the Center for Social Sciences (CSS) touches upon the ties between education and employment in Georgia and covers three main dimensions: individual return of education (financial benefits), compatibility of education with the labour market, and job satisfaction. Data analysis presented in this paper is based on the nationwide representative quantitative survey carried out by CSS in summer 2016 as a part International Social Survey Program (2015 Work Orientation IV Survey); we also used the World Bank 2013 statistical database. The data was analysed using the SPSS statistical program. The publication consists of three interconnected chapters. The structure consecutively follows the abovementioned topics that are actively studied by the economics of education in the contemporary world. Since our main objective was to show the real picture of the relations between education and employment in Georgia, we believe that the research findings will largely contribute to the better understanding and development of the state education policy."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "We  found  that  two  specific  dimensions  of  PSU  were  significant  mediators  of  the relationship  between  FoMO  and  decreased  emotional  well-being:  Cyberspace-oriented  Relations  and  Physical Symptoms. This suggests that the negative relationship between FoMO and decreased emotional well-being is due to FoMO stimulating (a) online relationships at the cost of offline interactions and (b) Physical symptoms associated with  excessive  smartphone  use."
