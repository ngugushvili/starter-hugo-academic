I am a quantitative researcher with eight years of experience, doing research in multiple settings, ranging from governmental to non-governmental and academic areas. I  work with different types of data (cross-sectional, longitudinal, secondary) and use various statistical tools and methods to tackle the research questions, including multivariate regression analysis, SEM, and multilevel modelling. 

As of now, I am a final-year doctoral student at Maastricht University and the University of Tartu. My research focuses on digital communication technology usage and its impact on mental health. I am also a (self-taught) Rstats enthusiast and an unconventional sci-fi geek.
